# StockMarketHelper
Code for my final project in my expert systems course with the knowledge base compiled from the knowledge of expert Michael Frankis, a former currency trader for several decades.

Determines whether the user should buy, sell, or wait based on the current state of the market. If a decision is
determined, tells the user the price at which they should buy or sell, when they should exit the market with a profit, 
and when they should accept a stop loss by exiting the market before it gets too bad.

Applies four distinct market strategies after asking the user several questions to determine the user's optimal
path.
